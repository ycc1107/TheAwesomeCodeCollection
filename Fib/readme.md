The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F0=0, F1=1, and then using the recursive formula


Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

to get the rest. Thus the sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... This sequence of Fibonacci numbers arises all over mathematics and also in nature.
However, if I wanted the 100th term of this sequence, it would take lots of intermediate calculations with the recursive formula to get a result. Is there an easier way?

Yes, there is an exact formula for the n-th term! It is:


an = [ Phin - (phi)n ]/Sqrt[5].

where Phi=(1+Sqrt[5])/2 is the so-called golden mean, and phi=(1-Sqrt[5])/2 is an associated golden number, also equal to (-1/Phi). This formula is attributed to Binet in 1843, though known by Euler before him.
